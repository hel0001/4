This simple BASIC program displays a welcome message and asks the user to enter their name. It then prints a personalized greeting using the entered name.

Line 10: REM is used to add a comment to the code. In this case, it's a comment indicating that this is an example BASIC program.

Line 20: PRINT is used to display the text "Hello, world!" on the screen.

Line 30: INPUT prompts the user to enter their name and stores it in the variable NAME$.

Line 40: PRINT displays a personalized greeting using the value entered by the user in line 30.

Line 50: END terminates the program.

This is a simple program, but it can be a good starting point for your GitHub repository to demonstrate how to use the BASIC language for basic tasks. You can add this description and code to files in your GitHub repository, and other developers can see and use it.
